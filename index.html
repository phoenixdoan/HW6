            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img src="Family.jpg" alt="Lunar New Year Celebration at Iowa Memorial Union, 2022">
            <p>My name is Phoenix Doan and I am a third year student studying Business Analytics and Information Systems at the University of Iowa Tippie College of Business. I was born and raised in Des Moines, Iowa. My parents immigrated here from Vietnam in 2000 and moved into a small apartment by the hospital I was born at. I am now 21 years old and I am the son of Jim Doan and Tammy Nguyen (pictured above). My family and I have remained in Iowa all of our lives and I believe they plan to retire there as well. I have one younger sibling, my brother, Phillip age 18. I also have a cousin who we sponsored here from Vietnam who also grew up living me. I practically consider her my sister because we grew up sharing a bed. </p>
            <p>When I was younger, I spent a lot of my time watching Youtube videos of fashion of lifestyle influencers. 
                I don’t have much family relatives in the United States so I grew up without grandparents and large family gatherings. Instead I spent a lot of time with other kids at the babysitters. I also spent a lot of time at my mom’s nail salon when she would work and I was waiting to be picked up from my dad. My parents were the first in our family to come to the United States so many of my childhood memories is of my parents working. However they did take us to travel a lot, I remember going to Disneyland and lots of road trips. I grew up going to temple every Sunday as well.</p>

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I went to Hoover High School in Des Moines for 2 years and then transferred to Urbandale High School in Urbandale, Iowa. Urbandale is a suburban neighborhood of Des Moines. Transferring there changed by mind and perspective and opened my eyes to many things. Des Moines schools were very diverse while Urbandale is majority white. I had been exposed to a different view of life that I didn’t know of. I took many college classes at Des Moines Community College and then went to University of Iowa. I am living with my two best friends Vi and Caroline (pictured below) I am now currently taking classes such as Data Wrangling, Database Management, and Computational Thinking. </p>
